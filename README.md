# Geo Guide

Five random events are placed on the arena at 5 positions. Using the overhead camera, the base station has to identify the events and conveys the information to the Vanguard robot. The robot, with the help of its path planning algorithms prepares a path to traverse the arena while following the correct priority as per the rulebook

We have to make the robot traverse a suitable path on the arena and enable real-time geo-tracking on QGIS while taking the event distribution on the arena and priority order into account.
priority order is 1)Fire 2)Destroyed building 3)Humanitarian Aid
4)Military Vehicles 5) Combat
